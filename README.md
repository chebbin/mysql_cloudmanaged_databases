## Experience with MySQL Workbench
Was unable to download the most updated version of Workbench. After trying to use popsql and trying to update my computer, downloaded an older version of Workbench. The first one I tried did not work, but the second one did.  
Created an instance called gcp hw 4 instance, and connected it to the IP address 35.202.156.109

Was able to create the ERD in the chevi database using the sample code in the 504 Github repo.
